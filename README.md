# Landlord Dashboard üè†

A full-stack property management system that automates rental income tracking, expense management, and roommate payment collection through intelligent bank synchronization and payment matching.

## üéØ Project Overview

I built this system to solve a real problem: managing shared expenses in my rental property. What started as manual spreadsheet tracking evolved into an automated system that saves hours of work each month while ensuring accurate financial records and timely payment collection.

### The Problem
- **Manual tracking** of utility bills and roommate payments was time-consuming and error-prone
- **Payment collection** required constant follow-ups and manual Venmo requests  
- **Financial reporting** for taxes required consolidating data from multiple sources
- **Bank reconciliation** was a monthly headache with hundreds of transactions

### The Solution
An intelligent automation system that handles everything from bank sync to payment tracking, reducing 10+ hours of monthly work to just minutes of review.

## üöÄ Key Features & Technical Achievements

### 1. Intelligent Bank Synchronization
- **Real-time API Integration**: Built secure connection to Bank of America via SimpleFIN API
- **Custom ETL Pipeline**: Designed rules engine that categorizes transactions with 95% accuracy
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Implemented transaction fingerprinting to prevent double-counting
- **Historical Import**: Processes years of CSV data for complete financial history
- **2-Week Quick Sync**: Dashboard buttons for targeted bank and Gmail syncs

### 2. Automated Payment Management System
- **Smart Bill Detection**: Algorithm identifies utility bills from transaction patterns
- **Automatic Split Calculation**: Precisely divides expenses among 3 roommates
- **Venmo Deep Linking**: Generates one-click payment URLs with pre-filled data
- **Tracking System**: Unique IDs enable automatic payment-to-request matching
- **Late Payment Handling**: Correctly attributes income to bill month, not payment date

### 3. Gmail OAuth Integration
- **Secure Authentication**: Implemented OAuth 2.0 flow without storing passwords
- **Email Parsing Engine**: Extracts structured data from Venmo confirmation emails
- **Confidence Scoring**: Developed matching algorithm with weighted scoring:
  - Amount match: 50% weight
  - Name match: 35% weight  
  - Note keywords: 15% weight
- **Special Rules**: Rent detection for payments ‚â•$1,600 starting August 2025
- **Ignore Functionality**: Ability to dismiss unimportant unmatched emails

### 4. Clean Architecture Implementation
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate `income` and `expenses` tables for clarity
- **Single Source of Truth**: Income table serves as authoritative revenue source
- **Stacked Revenue Charts**: Visual breakdown of rent vs utility reimbursements
- **Proper Month Attribution**: Late payments recorded in appropriate accounting period

### 5. Data Integrity & Health Monitoring
- **Health Check Dashboard**: Real-time system status monitoring
- **Process Pending Button**: One-click processing of 200+ raw transactions
- **Audit Logging**: Complete history of all database changes
- **Data Validation**: Middleware preventing impossible states
- **Backup/Restore System**: PostgreSQL dumps with restore capability
- **Caching Layer**: In-memory cache with TTL for performance

### 6. Real-time Notification System
- **Multi-channel Webhooks**: Discord integration for different event types
- **Rich Embeds**: Beautiful notification cards with actionable links
- **Status Tracking**: Automatic updates when payments are confirmed
- **Sync Logging**: Detailed logs of all sync operations with results

## üíª Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Material-UI, Recharts for data visualization
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL with raw SQL for performance
- **Integrations**: SimpleFIN API, Gmail OAuth 2.0, Discord Webhooks, Venmo URL Schemes
- **Infrastructure**: Docker for local development, PM2 for process management

### Database Design
```sql
-- Clean architecture with separated concerns
income               -- All revenue (rent, reimbursements) with proper month attribution
expenses             -- All property expenses with categorization
transactions         -- Processed bank transactions (legacy, being phased out)
raw_transactions     -- Unprocessed bank data requiring review  
payment_requests     -- Roommate payment tracking with Venmo links
etl_rules           -- Transaction categorization rules (priority 100+ = auto-approve)
venmo_emails        -- Gmail-synced payment confirmations with ignore capability
utility_bills       -- Detected utility expenses for splitting
utility_adjustments  -- Tracks reimbursements reducing net expenses
sync_history        -- Complete audit trail of all sync operations
audit_log           -- Database change tracking with before/after values
```

### Key Algorithms

#### Payment Matching Algorithm
```javascript
// Confidence scoring for payment-to-request matching
confidence = (
  amountMatch * 0.50 +    // Amount is most important
  nameMatch * 0.35 +      // Name verification
  noteMatch * 0.15        // Note keywords help confirm
);
```

#### Late Payment Attribution
```javascript
// Income recorded in bill month, not payment month
if (paymentRequest.month && paymentRequest.year) {
  incomeDate = new Date(paymentRequest.year, paymentRequest.month - 1, 
    paymentRequest.bill_type === 'rent' ? 1 : 15);
}
// Maintains accurate P&L per accounting period
```

#### Venmo Link Generation
```javascript
// Clean URL format that works on both mobile and web
https://venmo.com/USERNAME?txn=charge&amount=XX.XX&note=KEY:VALUE format
```
