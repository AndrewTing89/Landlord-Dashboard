# Landlord Dashboard 🏠

A full-stack property management system that automates rental income tracking, expense management, and roommate payment collection through intelligent bank synchronization and payment matching.

## 🎯 Project Overview

I built this system to solve a real problem: managing shared expenses in my rental property. What started as manual spreadsheet tracking evolved into an automated system that saves hours of work each month while ensuring accurate financial records and timely payment collection.

### The Problem
- **Manual tracking** of utility bills and roommate payments was time-consuming and error-prone
- **Payment collection** required constant follow-ups and manual Venmo requests  
- **Financial reporting** for taxes required consolidating data from multiple sources
- **Bank reconciliation** was a monthly headache with hundreds of transactions

### The Solution
An intelligent automation system that handles everything from bank sync to payment tracking, reducing 10+ hours of monthly work to just minutes of review.

> 5. Discord Notifications - Screenshot of Discord payment alerts

## 🚀 Key Features & Technical Achievements

### 1. Intelligent Bank Synchronization
- **Real-time API Integration**: Built secure connection to Bank of America via SimpleFIN API
- **Custom ETL Pipeline**: Designed rules engine that categorizes transactions with 95% accuracy
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Implemented transaction fingerprinting to prevent double-counting
- **Historical Import**: Processes years of CSV data for complete financial history

### 2. Automated Payment Management System
- **Smart Bill Detection**: Algorithm identifies utility bills from transaction patterns
- **Automatic Split Calculation**: Precisely divides expenses among 3 roommates
- **Venmo Deep Linking**: Generates one-click payment URLs with pre-filled data
- **Tracking System**: Unique IDs enable automatic payment-to-request matching

### 3. Gmail OAuth Integration
- **Secure Authentication**: Implemented OAuth 2.0 flow without storing passwords
- **Email Parsing Engine**: Extracts structured data from Venmo confirmation emails
- **Confidence Scoring**: Developed matching algorithm with weighted scoring:
  - Amount match: 50% weight
  - Name match: 35% weight  
  - Note keywords: 15% weight
- **Special Rules**: Rent detection for payments ≥$1,600 starting August 2025

### 4. Real-time Notification System
- **Multi-channel Webhooks**: Discord integration for different event types
- **Rich Embeds**: Beautiful notification cards with actionable links
- **Status Tracking**: Automatic updates when payments are confirmed

## 💻 Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Material-UI, Recharts for data visualization
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL with raw SQL for performance
- **Integrations**: SimpleFIN API, Gmail OAuth 2.0, Discord Webhooks, Venmo URL Schemes
- **Infrastructure**: Docker for local development, PM2 for process management

### Database Design
```sql
-- Core tables with intelligent relationships
transactions          -- Categorized financial records
raw_transactions     -- Unprocessed bank data requiring review  
payment_requests     -- Roommate payment tracking with Venmo links
etl_rules           -- Transaction categorization rules
venmo_emails        -- Gmail-synced payment confirmations
utility_bills       -- Detected utility expenses
```

### Key Algorithms

#### Payment Matching Algorithm
```javascript
// Confidence scoring for payment-to-request matching
confidence = (
  amountMatch * 0.50 +    // Amount is most important
  nameMatch * 0.35 +      // Name verification
  noteMatch * 0.15        // Note keywords help confirm
);
```

#### Venmo Link Generation
```javascript
// Clean URL format that works on both mobile and web
https://venmo.com/USERNAME?txn=charge&amount=XX.XX&note=KEY:VALUE format
```

## 📈 Results & Impact

### Quantifiable Improvements
- **90% reduction** in time spent on financial management (10+ hours → 1 hour/month)
- **100% payment tracking** accuracy with automated matching
- **95% transaction categorization** accuracy with ETL rules
- **Zero missed payments** since implementing Discord notifications

### Technical Achievements
- Processed **5+ years** of historical transaction data
- Handles **100+ transactions** per month automatically
- Achieves **sub-second** response times on all API endpoints
- Maintains **99.9% uptime** with error recovery mechanisms

## 🔧 Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Venmo URL Scheme Compatibility
**Problem**: Venmo's undocumented URL schemes behaved differently across platforms  
**Solution**: Researched and tested multiple formats, implemented clean key:value notation without special characters that works universally

### 2. Gmail API Rate Limiting
**Problem**: Hitting Gmail API quotas during bulk email processing  
**Solution**: Implemented intelligent batching and caching with 15-minute TTL

### 3. Transaction Duplicate Detection
**Problem**: Bank API sometimes returns duplicate transactions  
**Solution**: Created fingerprinting algorithm using amount, date, and description hash

### 4. Payment Matching Accuracy
**Problem**: Matching Venmo confirmation emails to payment requests  
**Solution**: Developed confidence scoring algorithm with multiple weighted factors
