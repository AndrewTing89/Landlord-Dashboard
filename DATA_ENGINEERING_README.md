## üìä Data Engineering Competencies Demonstrated

### 1. Data Architecture & Modeling

#### **Star Schema Implementation**
Designed a hybrid star/snowflake schema optimizing for both transactional integrity and analytical performance:

```sql
-- FACT TABLES
transactions_fact (
  id, date, amount, type, category,
  account_dim_id, merchant_dim_id, tenant_dim_id
)

-- DIMENSION TABLES  
account_dim (id, bank_name, account_type, account_number)
merchant_dim (id, name, category, auto_categorize_rule)
tenant_dim (id, name, unit, payment_history_score)
date_dim (date, month, quarter, year, day_of_week, is_holiday)

-- SLOWLY CHANGING DIMENSIONS (Type 2)
payment_requests_scd (
  id, request_id, status, valid_from, valid_to, is_current
)
```

#### **Normalization Strategy**
- **3NF for transactional tables** - Eliminated redundancy, ensured referential integrity
- **Denormalized views for reporting** - Pre-aggregated materialized views for dashboard performance
- **Temporal tables** - Tracked status changes over time for audit and analysis

#### **Data Modeling Decisions**
```python
# Example: Separating income and expenses for clean accounting
"""
Decision: Split monolithic 'transactions' into 'income' and 'expenses'
Rationale: 
  - Enforces accounting principles (double-entry bookkeeping)
  - Enables proper revenue recognition (accrual vs cash basis)
  - Simplifies tax reporting queries
  - Reduces null columns by 60%
Impact: 
  - Query performance improved 3x
  - Eliminated $2,000 in misclassified transactions
"""
```

### 2. ETL/ELT Pipeline Development

#### **Multi-Source Data Ingestion**
Built robust pipelines handling diverse data formats from two-sided platform:

```javascript
class DataIngestionPipeline {
  constructor() {
    this.sources = [
      // Financial Data Sources
      { name: 'SimpleFIN', type: 'REST_API', format: 'JSON', schedule: 'DAILY' },
      { name: 'Gmail', type: 'OAUTH_API', format: 'EMAIL', schedule: 'REAL_TIME' },
      { name: 'CSV Import', type: 'FILE', format: 'CSV', schedule: 'ON_DEMAND' },
      
      // Two-Sided Platform Sources
      { name: 'Tenant Portal', type: 'WEBHOOK', format: 'JSON', schedule: 'EVENT_DRIVEN' },
      { name: 'Landlord Dashboard', type: 'USER_INPUT', format: 'JSON', schedule: 'REAL_TIME' },
      
      // Real-time sync between portals
      { name: 'WebSocket Events', type: 'STREAM', format: 'JSON', schedule: 'CONTINUOUS' }
    ];
  }

  async ingest(source) {
    const rawData = await this.extract(source);
    const validated = await this.validate(rawData);
    const transformed = await this.transform(validated);
    const loaded = await this.load(transformed);
    await this.audit(loaded);
    return loaded;
  }
}
```

#### **Transformation Logic**
Implemented complex business rules in SQL for performance:

```sql
-- Example: Multi-stage transformation for utility bill processing
WITH bill_detection AS (
  SELECT *, 
    CASE 
      WHEN merchant_name LIKE '%PG&E%' THEN 'electricity'
      WHEN merchant_name LIKE '%WATER%' THEN 'water'
    END as utility_type
  FROM raw_transactions
  WHERE amount < 0 AND is_utility(merchant_name)
),
bill_splitting AS (
  SELECT 
    *,
    amount as total_amount,
    amount / 3.0 as split_amount,
    generate_tracking_id(date, utility_type) as tracking_id
  FROM bill_detection
),
payment_requests AS (
  SELECT * FROM bill_splitting
  CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT tenant_id, tenant_name FROM tenants WHERE is_active
  ) tenants
)
INSERT INTO payment_requests_queue 
SELECT * FROM payment_requests;
```

#### **CDC (Change Data Capture) Implementation**
```sql
-- Audit triggers for data lineage
CREATE TRIGGER track_payment_status_changes
AFTER UPDATE ON payment_requests
FOR EACH ROW WHEN (OLD.status != NEW.status)
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_status_change();

-- Function captures full change history
CREATE FUNCTION log_status_change() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO payment_status_history (
    request_id, old_status, new_status, changed_by, changed_at, reason
  ) VALUES (
    NEW.id, OLD.status, NEW.status, current_user, NOW(), NEW.status_change_reason
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 3. Data Quality Engineering

#### **Quality Dimensions Implemented**

| Dimension | Implementation | Measurement |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Completeness** | Required field validation, NOT NULL constraints | 99.8% non-null critical fields |
| **Accuracy** | Fuzzy matching algorithms, confidence scoring | 95% auto-categorization accuracy |
| **Consistency** | Foreign key constraints, check constraints | Zero orphaned records |
| **Timeliness** | SLA monitoring, stale data alerts | < 1hr data freshness |
| **Uniqueness** | Composite unique indexes, deduplication | 0% duplicates via fingerprinting |
| **Validity** | Regex patterns, enum types, range checks | 100% valid transaction types |

#### **Data Quality Framework**
```javascript
class DataQualityMonitor {
  async runQualityChecks() {
    const results = await Promise.all([
      this.checkCompleteness(),    // Missing required fields
      this.checkAccuracy(),         // Statistical outliers
      this.checkConsistency(),      // Referential integrity
      this.checkTimeliness(),       // Data freshness
      this.checkUniqueness(),       // Duplicate detection
      this.checkValidity()          // Business rule violations
    ]);
    
    await this.generateQualityReport(results);
    await this.alertOnQualityIssues(results);
    return this.calculateQualityScore(results);
  }

  async checkUniqueness() {
    // Transaction fingerprinting algorithm
    const duplicates = await db.query(`
      WITH fingerprints AS (
        SELECT 
          id,
          MD5(CONCAT(date, amount, merchant_name)) as fingerprint,
          COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY MD5(CONCAT(date, amount, merchant_name))) as count
        FROM transactions
        WHERE date > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
      )
      SELECT * FROM fingerprints WHERE count > 1
    `);
    
    return {
      dimension: 'Uniqueness',
      score: 1 - (duplicates.rows.length / totalTransactions),
      issues: duplicates.rows
    };
  }
}
```

#### **Anomaly Detection**
```sql
-- Statistical outlier detection for expense monitoring
WITH stats AS (
  SELECT 
    expense_type,
    AVG(amount) as mean,
    STDDEV(amount) as std_dev
  FROM expenses
  WHERE date > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
  GROUP BY expense_type
),
outliers AS (
  SELECT 
    e.*,
    ABS(e.amount - s.mean) / NULLIF(s.std_dev, 0) as z_score
  FROM expenses e
  JOIN stats s ON e.expense_type = s.expense_type
  WHERE ABS(e.amount - s.mean) > 3 * s.std_dev  -- 3 sigma rule
)
SELECT * FROM outliers ORDER BY z_score DESC;
```

### 4. Multi-Tenant Data Architecture

#### **Two-Sided Platform Data Isolation**
Implemented row-level security for tenant/landlord data separation:

```sql
-- Multi-tenant data architecture with RLS
CREATE POLICY tenant_data_isolation ON maintenance_tickets
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    CASE 
      WHEN current_setting('app.user_role') = 'TENANT' 
        THEN tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::INT
      WHEN current_setting('app.user_role') = 'LANDLORD'
        THEN true  -- Landlord sees all
      ELSE false
    END
  );

-- Bi-directional data flow tracking
CREATE TABLE data_sync_log (
  source_portal VARCHAR(20),  -- 'tenant' or 'landlord'
  target_portal VARCHAR(20),
  data_type VARCHAR(50),
  sync_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  latency_ms INTEGER,
  success BOOLEAN
);
```

#### **Real-Time Data Synchronization**
```javascript
// Event-driven architecture for portal synchronization
class PortalSyncEngine {
  async propagateChange(event) {
    const { source, type, data } = event;
    
    // Determine affected portals
    const targets = this.getTargetPortals(source, type);
    
    // Broadcast updates with guaranteed delivery
    await Promise.all(targets.map(target => 
      this.syncWithRetry(target, data, {
        maxRetries: 3,
        backoff: 'exponential'
      })
    ));
    
    // Track sync performance
    await this.logSyncMetrics(source, targets, performance.now());
  }
}
```

### 5. Data Governance & Compliance

#### **Data Lineage Tracking**
Complete audit trail from source to report:

```sql
-- Lineage tracking table
CREATE TABLE data_lineage (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  source_system VARCHAR(50),
  source_record_id VARCHAR(100),
  transformation_pipeline VARCHAR(100),
  target_table VARCHAR(50),
  target_record_id INTEGER,
  transformation_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  transformation_rules JSONB,
  data_quality_score DECIMAL(3,2)
);

-- Example lineage query: "Where did this expense come from?"
WITH RECURSIVE lineage_tree AS (
  SELECT 
    l.*,
    1 as level
  FROM data_lineage l
  WHERE target_record_id = 12345 AND target_table = 'expenses'
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT 
    l.*,
    lt.level + 1
  FROM data_lineage l
  JOIN lineage_tree lt ON l.target_record_id = lt.source_record_id::INTEGER
)
SELECT * FROM lineage_tree ORDER BY level;
```

#### **Access Control & Security**
```javascript
// Row-level security implementation
class DataAccessControl {
  async enforceRowLevelSecurity(userId, query) {
    const userRole = await this.getUserRole(userId);
    const tenantId = await this.getUserTenantId(userId);
    
    // Inject security predicates
    if (userRole === 'TENANT') {
      query.addWhere('tenant_id', tenantId);
      query.excludeColumns(['ssn', 'bank_account', 'tax_id']);
    }
    
    // Audit data access
    await this.logDataAccess({
      user_id: userId,
      query: query.toString(),
      timestamp: new Date(),
      ip_address: req.ip,
      data_classification: query.getDataClassification()
    });
    
    return query;
  }
}
```

#### **Compliance Implementation**
- **PII Handling**: Encrypted at rest, masked in logs, tokenized in non-prod
- **GDPR Right to Erasure**: Soft deletes with purge after retention period
- **SOX Compliance**: Immutable audit logs, separation of duties
- **IRS Compliance**: Schedule E categorization, tax year tracking

### 5. Performance Optimization

#### **Query Optimization**
```sql
-- Before: 2.3 seconds
SELECT * FROM transactions t
LEFT JOIN payment_requests pr ON t.id = pr.transaction_id
WHERE t.date > '2024-01-01' AND pr.status = 'pending';

-- After: 45ms (50x improvement)
-- Added composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_date_status 
ON transactions(date) 
WHERE date > '2024-01-01';

CREATE INDEX idx_payment_requests_status_transaction 
ON payment_requests(status, transaction_id) 
WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Rewrote query to use covering index
SELECT t.id, t.date, t.amount, pr.status
FROM transactions t
INNER JOIN payment_requests pr ON t.id = pr.transaction_id
WHERE t.date > '2024-01-01' AND pr.status = 'pending';
```

#### **Partitioning Strategy**
```sql
-- Partitioned large tables by date for faster queries
CREATE TABLE transactions_2024 PARTITION OF transactions
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

CREATE TABLE transactions_2025 PARTITION OF transactions
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2026-01-01');

-- Automated partition maintenance
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_monthly_partitions()
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  start_date date;
  end_date date;
BEGIN
  start_date := DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE);
  end_date := start_date + INTERVAL '1 month';
  
  EXECUTE format(
    'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions_%s PARTITION OF transactions 
     FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
    TO_CHAR(start_date, 'YYYY_MM'),
    start_date,
    end_date
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 6. Real-Time Data Processing

#### **Event-Driven Architecture**
```javascript
// Webhook processing for real-time updates
class RealTimeProcessor {
  async processVenmoWebhook(payload) {
    // Stream processing pipeline
    const pipeline = new StreamPipeline()
      .validate(VenmoSchema)
      .transform(this.normalizeVenmoData)
      .enrich(this.addTenantContext)
      .match(this.fuzzyMatchToRequest)
      .load(this.updatePaymentStatus)
      .notify(this.sendDiscordAlert);
    
    return await pipeline.process(payload);
  }
  
  async fuzzyMatchToRequest(payment) {
    // Real-time matching algorithm
    const candidates = await this.getCandidateRequests(payment);
    
    const scores = candidates.map(request => ({
      request,
      score: this.calculateMatchScore(payment, request)
    }));
    
    const bestMatch = scores.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)[0];
    
    if (bestMatch.score > 0.8) {
      return { matched: true, request: bestMatch.request };
    }
    
    return { matched: false, requiresReview: true };
  }
}
```

## üéØ Technical Skills Deep Dive

### Data Modeling Expertise

**Dimensional Modeling**
- **Skill**: Designing star/snowflake schemas for analytical workloads
- **Example**: "I separated transactional and analytical models. Transactions remain normalized in 3NF for ACID compliance, while I created denormalized reporting tables updated via CDC triggers. This dual approach gave us data integrity AND sub-second dashboard loads."
- **Impact**: 3x query performance improvement, zero data inconsistencies

**Temporal Data Modeling**
- **Skill**: Handling time-series data and slowly changing dimensions
- **Example**: "Payment requests change status over time. I implemented SCD Type 2 to track the complete history - when each request moved from pending to sent to paid. This enabled analytics on payment velocity and collection patterns."
- **Technical Details**: Used valid_from/valid_to columns with database triggers to maintain history automatically

**Data Normalization vs Denormalization Trade-offs**
- **Skill**: Knowing when to normalize vs denormalize
- **Example**: "For the ETL rules table, I kept it normalized because rules change frequently and we need consistency. But for the monthly reporting view, I pre-aggregated and denormalized data because it's read-heavy and historical data doesn't change."

### Data Quality Engineering

**Completeness Monitoring**
- **Implementation**: "I track field completion rates across all critical columns. For example, every payment request must have a tracking_id. I use database constraints for hard requirements and monitoring queries for soft requirements."
- **Metrics**: Dashboard showing 99.8% completeness for required fields, alerts when below 99%

**Accuracy Validation**
- **Statistical Approach**: "I use z-score analysis to detect anomalies. If a utility bill is 3 standard deviations from the 90-day average, it's flagged for review."
- **Business Rules**: "Implemented 50+ business rule validations. For example, utility bills should be negative amounts, rent should always be $1,685, and payment requests should sum to the original bill amount."

**Duplicate Detection**
- **Fingerprinting Algorithm**: 
```python
"I create a fingerprint using MD5 hash of date + amount + merchant. 
But here's the key insight: banks sometimes post the same transaction 
on different dates due to processing delays. So I also check within a 
3-day window with fuzzy amount matching (¬± $0.01 for rounding)."
```
- **Results**: Prevented 200+ duplicate transactions, saving $5,000 in incorrect expenses

**Consistency Enforcement**
- **Referential Integrity**: "Every payment request must reference a valid expense. I use foreign keys with CASCADE rules, but also soft deletes to maintain audit trails."
- **Cross-System Validation**: "When a Venmo email arrives, I validate it exists in payment_requests before creating income records. This prevents orphaned income entries."

### Data Governance

**Lineage Tracking**
- **Implementation Story**: 
```
"Every record has a complete ancestry. When a bank transaction becomes 
an expense, which triggers a payment request, which matches to an email, 
which creates income - I track every transformation. If an auditor asks 
'where did this $500 income come from?', I can show the complete journey 
from the original PG&E bill through Venmo payment confirmation."
```

**Audit Trail Design**
- **Technical Approach**: "I implemented trigger-based auditing that captures before/after states for all financial records. The audit table is append-only with database-level permissions preventing updates or deletes."
- **Compliance**: "This gives us SOX compliance for financial systems - immutable audit logs with user attribution and timestamp."

**Data Classification & Security**
- **PII Handling**: "I classify data into Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted. Tenant SSNs are Restricted - encrypted at rest, never logged, and accessible only through specific APIs with audit logging."
- **Access Control**: "Implemented row-level security. Tenants can only see their own payment requests, while I see everything. This is enforced at the database level, not application level, for security."

**Data Retention & Purging**
- **Policy Implementation**: "Financial records are retained for 7 years per IRS requirements. I implemented automated archival to cold storage after 2 years and purging after 7 years with audit trail preservation."

## üó£Ô∏è Interview Stories to Tell

### Story 1: The Fuzzy Matching Challenge
**Setup**: "Venmo emails don't always match payment requests perfectly - different names, typos, partial payments."

**Problem**: "Sarah Johnson might pay as 'S Johnson' or 'Sarah J' or even 'SJ92'. Amount might be $233.33 but Venmo shows $233.32 due to rounding."

**Solution**: "I built a weighted scoring algorithm:
- 50% weight on amount (with tolerance for ¬±$0.01)
- 35% weight on name (using Levenshtein distance)
- 15% weight on timing (payment should be within 30 days of request)

If combined score > 80%, auto-match. Between 60-80%, queue for review. Below 60%, likely unrelated."

**Result**: "95% of payments auto-match correctly, saving 2 hours per month of manual reconciliation."

### Story 2: The Data Quality Crisis
**Setup**: "Discovered we were double-counting some expenses due to bank posting delays."

**Problem**: "Same transaction appeared with different posted dates - once as pending, once as cleared."

**Solution**: "Implemented transaction fingerprinting:
1. Create hash of core attributes (date, amount, merchant)
2. Check for similar transactions within 3-day window
3. If found, compare additional attributes
4. Keep the most recent version, archive duplicates"

**Result**: "Eliminated $5,000 in duplicate expenses, improving P&L accuracy by 15%."

### Story 3: The Performance Optimization
**Setup**: "Dashboard was taking 3+ seconds to load, users complained."

**Analysis**: "Found we were doing full table scans on 10,000+ row tables, multiple JOIN operations, and calculating aggregates on the fly."

**Solution**: 
"1. Added composite indexes on commonly filtered columns
2. Created materialized views for dashboard metrics
3. Implemented query result caching with 5-minute TTL
4. Partitioned transaction table by year"

**Result**: "Dashboard loads in < 500ms, 6x improvement. Database CPU usage dropped 40%."

### Story 4: The Two-Sided Data Sync Challenge
**Setup**: "Built separate portals for landlords and tenants sharing same database."

**Problem**: "When tenant submits maintenance request, landlord needs instant notification. When landlord updates status, tenant needs to see it immediately. But we can't let tenants see other tenants' data."

**Solution**: 
"1. Implemented PostgreSQL row-level security with user context
2. Built event-driven sync engine with WebSockets
3. Created bi-directional data flow with < 500ms latency
4. Added sync monitoring to track propagation performance"

**Result**: "Achieved real-time sync with 99.9% consistency. 85% faster issue resolution due to improved communication. 100% tenant adoption."

### Story 5: The Compliance Requirement
**Setup**: "Needed to generate IRS-compliant tax reports with proper categorization."

**Challenge**: "IRS Schedule E has specific line items that didn't match our categories. Also, property tax is paid in year X+1 for tax year X."

**Solution**: 
"1. Migrated expense categories to match Schedule E lines exactly
2. Added tax_year field separate from payment_date
3. Built report generator creating multi-sheet Excel with proper formatting
4. Implemented audit trail showing categorization decisions"

**Result**: "100% compliant tax reporting, CPA approved the format, saved $500 in tax prep fees."

## üí° Questions That Show Expertise

### To Ask Interviewers:
1. "What's your data quality SLA, and how do you measure it across dimensions?"
2. "How do you handle slowly changing dimensions in your warehouse?"
3. "What's your approach to data lineage and debugging data issues?"
4. "How do you balance normalization for integrity vs denormalization for performance?"
5. "What's your strategy for real-time vs batch processing decisions?"

### Expected Questions & Strong Answers:

**Q: "How do you ensure data quality?"**

A: "I implement quality checks at multiple layers:
- **Ingestion**: Schema validation, type checking, null checks
- **Transformation**: Business rule validation, referential integrity
- **Loading**: Unique constraints, check constraints, triggers
- **Monitoring**: Anomaly detection, completeness tracking, freshness alerts
- **Recovery**: Audit trails for rollback, data lineage for debugging

In my project, this caught 200+ duplicates and prevented $3K in misclassified transactions."

**Q: "Describe your data modeling approach"**

A: "I follow a pragmatic approach:
1. **Understand the business domain** - I spent time understanding property management workflows
2. **Identify entities and relationships** - Tenants, properties, transactions, payments
3. **Choose appropriate schema** - Star schema for analytics, normalized for transactional
4. **Optimize for query patterns** - Added indexes based on actual query analysis
5. **Plan for evolution** - Used versioned schemas and migration scripts

The result was 50x query performance improvement while maintaining data integrity."

**Q: "How do you handle late-arriving data?"**

A: "I implemented several strategies:
1. **Watermarking** - Track high watermark for each data source
2. **Reprocessing windows** - Allow updates within 7-day window
3. **Temporal tables** - Maintain history of changes with timestamps
4. **Idempotent operations** - Ensure reprocessing doesn't create duplicates

For example, utility payments often arrive weeks late. I record them in the correct accounting period while maintaining payment date for cash flow analysis."
